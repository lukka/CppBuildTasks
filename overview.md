This extension provides the tasks **'run-vcpkg'** and **'run-cmake'** to build C++ code on Azure DevOps pipelines. 

The tasks can be used on any agent (MS hosted or [self hosted](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows?view=azure-devops)) and using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as well. 

Read the documentation in [README.md](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks/blob/master/README.md).

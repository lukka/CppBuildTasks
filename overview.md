This extension provides the tasks **'run-vcpkg'** and **'run-cmake'** to build C++ code on Azure DevOps pipelines. Full examples and real world projects are provided in the [README.md](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks/blob/master/README.md) file.

## The ***run-vcpkg*** task

The task verifies whether vcpkg is already located at the value specified for `vcpkgDirectory` (e.g. vcpkg could be a submodule of the Git repository). If it is not there, it uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to fetch [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) into that directory. When needed vcpkg is build, and eventually vcpkg is launched to build and install the specified ports.
The task sets `VCPKG_ROOT` environment/task variable, which is automatically used by subsequent **'run-cmake'** to consume the vcpkg's toolchain file.

### Use vcpkg as a submodule of your Git repository ###

When using this task be aware that:
 - a version of vcpkg is obtainined checking out the sources of vcpkg at a given commit id, or tag (e.g. release tag `2019.07`);
 - given a checkout of a version of vcpkg, each port is provided at a specific version, e.g. there are no multiple versions of the same port;
 - it is not possible to  choose which version of the port to install, instead it is the given version of vcpkg that established which version of the port is going to install;
 
 To sum up, it is suggested to stick to a specific version of vcpkg that fits your needs, that means a specific commit id of vcpkg that contains all the ports at the desired version should be used during your development cycle. To keep a consistent development experience between local and remote builds, **it is highly suggested to use vcpkg as submodule of your Git repository**; this way the version of vcpkg used is implied by the submodule.

### Use vcpkg's response file as parameter

vcpkg accepts a response file that contains its arguments. It is useful to store under source control a text file containing the list of ports and triplets to be installed. This helps to run the vcpkg exactly the same way locally and on the build servers. For example if you want to run:

 > vcpkg install boost zlib:x64 libmodbus --triplet x64

it is possible to run

 > vcpkg install @response_file.txt

 where `response_file.txt` contains (with no trailing whitespace allowed):

```yaml
   boost
   zlib:x64
   libmodbus
   --triplet
   x64
```



### Caching vcpkg's artifacts

To minimize build time, the [Cache task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/caching/?view=azure-devops) should be used to cache the entire vcpkg's directory (which is specified by `vcpkgDirectory` of **'run-vcpkg'** task).

_Note:_ since only the `installed` directory and the `vcpkg` file should be cached, everything but those are excluded by the `.artifactignore` file generated by the *vcpkg-run* task.

The `key` provided to the Cache task must uniquely identify the following:
  - the vcpkg version, which identifies also all the provided ports and their specific version;
  - the used triplet and the list of ports to be built and installed;
  - the platform and the toolset used when building ports;

The following sample [key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/caching/?view=azure-devops#task-configuration) should grant most of the above:

```yaml
key:  $(vcpkgCommitId)| @$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/response_file_with_ports_and_triplet.txt | "$(Agent.OS)"
```
where:
  - the `$(vcpkgCommitId)` identifies a specific version of vcpkg by means of a Git commit id or tag. It is suggested to use vcpkg as a submodule of your repository, at the root for example, in such case the commit id is stored in file `$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/.git/modules/vcpkg/HEAD`. Note that a branch name should not be used, as it does not  identify uniquely the version of vcpkg;
  - the response file contains the list of ports along with the triplet, e.g. 

    ```sqlite3 --triplet x64-linux```

    or another example 
  
    `sqlite3:x64-windows`. The `--triplet` argument specifies the default value when a port has not the triplet specified.
  
  - `$(Agent.OS)` captures only the build agent platform. If needed, it might be useful to add further values in the key to uniquely identifies the toolset used when building.

_Note:_ the key must be a one liner, it could be divided in segments with the pipe character, each non-file-path segment must be enclosed with double quotes. [As documented](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/caching/?view=azure-devops#key-input), for file-path segments a hash value is computed, while the non-file-path segment values are used as is.


## The ***run-cmake*** task

The **'run-cmake'** task works with CMakeLists.txt and [CMakeSettings.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmakesettings-reference?view=vs-2019).
It can leverage the previous execution of the **'run-vcpkg'** task by using the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment/task variable to:

  - set the vcpkg's toolchain file if requested, located at `$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`;
  - set the environment for the provided triplet when building with [msvc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/c-cpp-building-reference?view=vs-2019) on Windows (i.e. building in the environment created by launching `$VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg env`); 
 
## Questions and Answers

### Why not one single task?

Because you could use vcpkg without CMake. Or you could use CMake without vcpkg.

### Would creating an ad-hoc bash/powershell script be easier?

Absolutely! Anyone can use this task as an inspiration for writing their own scripts to suite specific needs.
The purpose of the tasks is to streamline and to simplify the usage of vcpkg and CMake on build servers.

This extension provides the multi-platform tasks **'run-vcpkg'** and **'run-cmake'** to build C++ code on Azure DevOps pipelines. 

These tasks can be used on any agent (MS hosted or [self hosted](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows?view=azure-devops)) and using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as well. 

Read the documentation in [README.md](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks/blob/master/README.md).

The same tasks are available as GitHub actions:

 - [run-vcpkg GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg);
 - [run-cmake GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake);
